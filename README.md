My all beginner python projects


## 1_star_field.py

A simple tkinter program to learn how to use tkinter and OOPs concept.


## RAY CASTING

In this program, I implement a basic ray casting engine with line segment "surfaces" and vector "rays." The result simulates a light source casting shadows in a 2D canvas. And also learn how to take inputs from mouse in tkinter and how thing work according to user input.

## Rendering Raycasting

Building off of the previous coding challenge (2D Ray Casting) I attempt to make my own version the original Wolfenstein 3D Raycasting engine and visualize the "field of view" of the moving particle.
