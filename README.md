My all beginner python projects


## StarFiels

A simple tkinter program to learn how to use tkinter and OOPs concept.


## RAY CASTING

In this program, I implement a basic ray casting engine with line segment "surfaces" and vector "rays." The result simulates a light source casting shadows in a 2D canvas. And also learn how to take inputs from mouse in tkinter and how thing work according to user input.
