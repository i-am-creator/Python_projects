## [StarFiels](https://github.com/i-am-creator/Python_projects/blob/master/1_star_field.py)

A simple tkinter program to learn how to use tkinter and OOPs concept.

## [RAY CASTING](https://github.com/i-am-creator/Python_projects/blob/master/2_2D_RayCasting.py)

In this program, I implement a basic ray casting engine with line segment "surfaces" and vector "rays." The result simulates a light source casting shadows in a 2D canvas. And also learn how to take inputs from mouse in tkinter and how thing work according to user input.

## [Rendering Raycasting](3_Rendering_Raycasting.py)

Building off of the previous coding challenge (2D Ray Casting) I attempt to make my own version the original Wolfenstein 3D Raycasting engine and visualize the "field of view" of the moving particle.

## [BOIDS](4_biods.py)


In this program, I create a flocking simulation in Python based on Craig Reynolds ["boids" algorithm](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/).

The basic flocking model consists of three simple steering behaviors which describe how an individual boid maneuvers based on the positions and velocities its nearby flockmates:

###    Separation: 
          steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
###    Alignment:
          steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
###    Cohesion:
          steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates
          
          
          
## [Bézier curve](5_BézierCurve.py)

A Bézier curve (/ˈbɛz.i.eɪ/ BEH-zee-ay)[1] is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related fields.[2] The curve, which is related to the Bernstein polynomial, is named after Pierre Bézier, who used it in the 1960s for designing curves for the bodywork of Renault cars.
